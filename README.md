#Activity Points Program
##Description
This program can be used to track activity points. Teachers log in and create clubs/teams. Students will then log in and join the corresponding clubs/teams they are appart of. At the end of the semester, the teachers will log in and assign each student how many activity points they deserve (up to a max of 10). Upon graduation, the program will print out certificates if the students have a certain number of activity points.
